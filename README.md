Hello Senior, I hope you are having a good day.


Step 1: Open `index.html` that resides in root directory using Live Server

Step 2: 

Then, there is a `script.sh` file in root directory. Please run it.

`sh script.sh`

This script will basically run all my node projects in your PC.


Step 3: 

Then there is one `finalDBSchema.sql` file which will import all my databases in your system. PS: there is no need to create schema separately.


Everything should be working perfectly now. If not then please let me know.
